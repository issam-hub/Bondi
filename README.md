## My Process

### Built With

-   [x] HTML
-   [x] CSS/SASS
-   [x] JavaScript
-   [x] Bootstrap (new Soldier In the field âš”)

### What I Learned

-   bootstrap, it's amazing framework that saves me a lot of time, specially in the responsive stuff

-   but in my opinion i don't like much because it has limited components and gives only the standards of the current web design or so, and that will limiting the creativity and innovation a bet, so next time or so inchallah will do something with tailwind and see what's what
